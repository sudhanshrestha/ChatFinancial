# Financial Prediction App with LLM Integration (Work-in Progress)

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a financial prediction application that utilizes machine learning models to predict spending and income amounts based on user input. Additionally, the application will integrate a language model to act as a financial advisor, providing insights and guidance on managing finances.

## Current Accomplishment (Dev branch)
   - ollama 3.2 3B in device, so it might run on mostly any device. (DONE)
   - RAG implementation to not let it derail from context (DONE)

## Future tests 
- CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation) implmentation just want to try it out to see what's different ?
