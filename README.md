# Financial Prediction App with LLM Integration (Work-in Progress)

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop a financial prediction application that utilizes machine learning models to predict spending and income amounts based on user input. Additionally, the application will integrate a language model to act as a financial advisor, providing insights and guidance on managing finances.

## Current Progress (Dev branch)
- Since prediction on small dataset is not viable right now , will try to shif this project into more of a summary of personal finances.
- Integrating LLMs to act as a financial advisor that will answer your financial question ?
   - LLMs being tested: 
      - Different Hugging face models
      - Gemeni ( Being tested)
      - Llama (TO DO)
